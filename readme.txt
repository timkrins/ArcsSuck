ArcsSuck 0.1 by Tim Krins

Designed to take a GCode NC file and convert all arcs into small linear movements.
Drag and drop your file onto the executable, it will write a file called "converted.txt".

This is a useful tool when using CNC machines that are controlled by microcontrollers.
Should be cross platform compatible.

My code may be messy... I have learned how to write C basically by trial and error.


Apart from that, its sweet!
